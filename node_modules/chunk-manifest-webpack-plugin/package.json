  "readme": "# chunk-manifest-webpack-plugin\n\nAllows exporting a JSON file that maps chunk ids to their resulting asset files. Webpack can then read this mapping, assuming it is provided somehow on the client, instead of storing a mapping (with chunk asset hashes) in the bootstrap script, which allows to actually leverage long-term caching.\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall via npm:\n\n```shell\nnpm install chunk-manifest-webpack-plugin\n```\n\nAnd then require and provide to webpack:\n\n```javascript\n// in webpack.config.js or similar\nvar ChunkManifestPlugin = require('chunk-manifest-webpack-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  // your config values here\n  plugins: [\n    new ChunkManifestPlugin({\n      filename: \"manifest.json\",\n      manifestVariable: \"webpackManifest\"\n    })\n  ]\n};\n```\n\n### Options\n\n#### `filename`\n\nWhere the manifest will be exported to on bundle compilation. This will be relative to the main webpack output directory. Default = `\"manifest.json\"`\n\n#### `manifestVariable`\n\nWhat JS variable on the client webpack should refer to when requiring chunks. Default = `\"webpackManifest\"`\n",
